- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cobrachainsaw (Vinayak Thakur)
- 👀 I’m interested in building scaleable solutions using GoLang and infering causalties in Machine/Deep Learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spark and Snowflake to build ETL pipelines; keras and pytorch to help improve transparency in black box deep learning models.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on anything as long as it intrigues me.
